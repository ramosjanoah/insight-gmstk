This is the kind of song that makes you feel something.\n\nThis song is about a relationship gone sour. That is pretty obvious. But there are hints about the distance being at fault for the relationship ending. It is really unclear though. So take it with a grain of salt.\n\nAnyways, this song leans more onto rock but not full on. More alternative really."

But only when they are done well. Like She's casual and I can feel a hot one, and like those songs you don't get bored. \nAnyways. What I grasped from the lyrics were that this man met a woman named isabel. They had a one night stand. But she left the next morning. Leaving him alone when he wanted something more. \nGive it a listen. It's kind of slow but it is really good."

Especially after the message of the whole album.\n\nThis song, the whole album actually is about depression. And ways to cope with it. In this song it's made clearer. \nAnyways. This is punk rock, so if you don't like that give it a try. I swear it\"s a great song."

And this song is one of their best. \nThese lyrics have many lyrics. I like to think that it's about a man and a woman who love eachother but the relationship is not working, so they break up out of love for each other. They don't want to harm one another. But there's also the meaning that it's about nature and humans. Tbh it's up to the listener to think about the meaning.\n\nAnyways. Great fucking band."

The guy messed up at a party and the girl got mad at him. He has a great deal of regret and is pretty sad. \nThe album's name is never trust a happy song so... I think it makes sense. Great song"

But they are pretty damn good. \nAnyways, this song os about self acceptance, you shouldn't be scared of change and should be proud of who you are. I think that's a pretty powerfull message in it's own. It's your life, live it the way you want it to, not by society's ways.\n\nGrouplove is amazing and I am so hyped to possibly see them in november."

She had died but he didn't want to admit it. So he stepped out and started crying on the pavement. Ambulamces started arriving and they took his wife. Then it's implied he died in the verse of the child crying in her stomach. But I think his children also died, hence why he is crying\n\nIn reality though, in an interview they admitted it's only a dream so... Anyways, this son is sad and the chords go perfectly with the voice. It really is a song about tragedy."

And this song is arguably one of their best.\n\nOkey the sing talks about a relationship. It can mean many things but it is definetly a relationship.\nOne of the thinga I read was that it talks about an abusive relationship. Or a relationship that just lost it's spark.\nPersonally I think it talks about a man who wants this girl badly. But he can't get her.\n\nAnyways please listen to this it's fucking great."

Jesus it's great. The guitar, the drums, the vocals. Everything. I also get a kings of leon vibe.\n\nAnyways. I think the lyrics are about an abusive relationship (physical or emotional.) and the guy is caught off guard when she suddenly is nice. \"Not like you to be uncruel.\" is the prime example for this. \nAnyways. I discovered this song in my discover weekly. Great fucking song."

The  album art is goregeous.\n\nThe lyrics are about a girl who rises up and fights. She is on her own and is a \"rebel\" at least that's what I got about it. \nSeriously this song reminds me of the old school rock and roll songs. It's great."

It's fucking great.\n\nTbh I don't really kniw what the lyrics mean. They are kind of all over the place. But I think it's either about a toxic relationship, or a couple that wants to escape to be together against other people's wishes. \nGuys for real. This is a fucking great song. Please give it a listen if you even remotley like the killers."

The narrator is trying to \"blank her out\" (forget her) but he can't. He's heartbroken. Everything he sees remimds him of her. When he's alone all he thinks is about her. \nNow the song itself is kind of slow. But at the same time very soft rock? Idk it's hard to explain. Give this song a listen (Btw I'm currently listening to brand new's mew album. Tbh it's kind of meh. Have to finish it.)"

Anyways it's about this couple who are going through a rough patch, both are heartbroken and struggling with their circumstances. So they sat down to have an evening for themeselves and started talking and fell back in love.\n\nTbh I love the script and this whole album is great but this song is one of the better ones. Check this band out. Especially songs like breakeven and man who csn't be moved."

And I like it. \nAnyways. The lyrics.\nI think they talk about this guy wanting to get into a relationship with a girl. The girl is not so on board. But he is trying to convince her. Therefore \"Give me a try\" and \"this could be a drug that doesn't bite.\" This paralels other songs that talk about the breakup. This talks about the begining of a relationship.\nAnyways I love the sound of this song. It is different. But it is extremely good."

Now this guy is a lyrical genius. Almost every line can be interpreted differently. But the meaning is still the same. A guy messed up, he feels extremely guilty about it. The girl forgave him, but she still feels betrayed for what he did. She doesn't know what to do with the relationship. \"Call it quits or get a grip, you said you wanted a solution you just wanted to be missed.\" To be honest I could go all day about the lyrics. Brand New is awesome. You won't regret listening to this song."

At first he is young again, then he'll fall for her, then he will die for her.\n\nI think this song is more rock than not. But give this band a chance. It is great."

For example \"if only she was born a son then maybe she'd still have a head.\" talks about the beheading of marie antonniete. It holds a positive view om feminism without being \"up in your face\". That's pretty much it for the lyrics.\n\nThis might very well be their best song yet. And that is something considering circulation was the greatest album."

Anyways I think this song is pretty explicit. It's about war and whats wrong with it, it's spoils. Death, destruction. And eventually they blame god for the death. Either that or a person close to them died. And the song is about mourning. This is more on the acoustic side. Very slow but great song nonetheless."

Phoenix said that this song is about 19th century paris (Eiffel Tower etc.) but the lyrics don't really match up. What I think is happening is a couple on the verge of breaking up, the man (who we see telling the story) is fading in and out of the realtionship, he knows the \"Futures Sorted Out\" and doesn't care, he knows they are breaking up. Just like paris, they built the eiffel tower, then it became a tourist atraction. They are now stuck in the past. \nGreat song, even better lyrics."

            "text": "You found me\nThe Fray\nThe Fray \"You Found Me\" is a song about faith and the many many let downs of life. The singer is losing his faith in god because everything has been going bad in his life. He is bling god for everything that is happening to him. For not helping him when he asked (\"I've been calling for years and you never left me no messages, never sent me no letters.\") all around a pretty powerfull song. And a great one, sure it's a little old but it is pretty good."

It helps us really feel what they are feeling. Having you Significant Other go to a bar, or a concert without you when you don't trust them. And you getting angry at them. Lyrics aside though the melody is great (what can you expect from Cold War Kids?) and this song has more of a serious tone. Great song, great band."

As in \"I'll be alright if I can just see you.\" this basically means that everything will be alright if he can see the thing he loves. In this case his dreams.

The lyrics talk about a relationship, possibly being doomed at the end. They are trying their best to make it together as seen in \"I'll think about tommorrow if I can get through tonight. I know that we'll be alright. Can we be strong?\" This song is really good with meaningfull lyrics (like most of cold war kids songs) definetly check it out."

There are more docile songs, such as \"Souther Comforting\" and \"Tennis Shoes\". This is definetly a do not miss if you like well thought lyrics (listen to brandon and then google brandon teena). Circulation is also a magnificent song."

From the Maze to the silence every single song tells a story about a family in a town. From the miners in \"the gold\" to the car crash in \"the wolf\" even to the heartwarming love story of \"the parts\" and especially the gutwrentching \"the silence\". Having a wide variety of styles yet not strafing too far from their own style, this is a must have for every music lover."
